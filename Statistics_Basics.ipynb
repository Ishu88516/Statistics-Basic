        "\n",
        "What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics? Explain with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistics is broadly classified into descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Descriptive statistics deals with methods used to summarize, organize, and present data in a meaningful way. It does not draw conclusions beyond the given data. Common measures include mean, median, mode, charts, and graphs.\n",
        "Example: Calculating the average marks of students in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inferential statistics involves methods used to draw conclusions or make predictions about a population based on a sample. It includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, correlation, and regression.\n",
        "Example: Using a sample survey to estimate customer satisfaction of all customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2\n",
        "\n",
        "What is sampling in statistics? Explain the differences between random sampling and stratified sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or observations from a population to represent the entire population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random sampling is a method where every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. It is simple and reduces bias.\n",
        "Example: Randomly selecting 50 students from a college.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stratified sampling divides the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and samples are taken from each group. This ensures better representation.\n",
        "Example: Selecting students separately from each department.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3\n",
        "\n",
        "Define mean, median, and mode. Explain why these measures of central tendency are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean is the average of all values, calculated by dividing the sum of values by the number of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "These measures are important because they summarize large data into a single representative value, making comparison and interpretation easier. Mean shows overall performance, median avoids the effect of extreme values, and mode identifies the most common value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4\n",
        "\n",
        "Explain skewness and kurtosis. What does a positive skew imply about the data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness measures the asymmetry of a data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Positive skew → tail on the right side\n",
        "\n",
        "Negative skew → tail on the left side\n",
        "\n",
        "A positive skew implies that most values are concentrated on the lower side, with a few extremely high values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kurtosis measures the peakedness or flatness of a distribution. High kurtosis indicates a sharp peak, while low kurtosis indicates a flat distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 5\n",
